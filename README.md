## üéØ What We're Building

### The Problem
Professional pilots use **Flight Crew View** for their schedules and **LogTen Pro** for their digital logbooks. Currently, they must manually transfer flight data between these apps, which is:
- Time-consuming (manual data entry)
- Error-prone (especially timezone conversions)
- Tedious (repetitive work)

### The Solution: FlightBridge
An automated sync service that:
1. Connects to Flight Crew View via official OAuth API
2. Automatically fetches flight data
3. Applies intelligent timezone corrections
4. Generates one-click import URLs for LogTen Pro
5. Keeps logbooks up-to-date in real-time

### Target Market
- Professional airline pilots (US domestic airlines)
- Airlines using FLICA scheduling system
- Pilots using LogTen Pro for their logbook
- Estimated 10,000+ potential users

### Business Model
- **Price:** $9.99/month subscription
- **Trial:** 14-day free trial
- **Value Prop:** Save hours per month, ensure accuracy
- **Break-even:** 3 users = $29.97 > $20.60 costs

## üéØ Next Immediate Actions (Priority Order)

### 1. **OAuth Start Workflow** üî¥ **DO THIS FIRST**
**Goal:** Allow users to connect their FCView account

**Steps:**
1. Get your FCView Client ID & Client Secret (you have this)
2. Create new n8n workflow: "OAuth Start"
3. Add webhook node: `/webhook/oauth-start`
4. Add Code node to generate FCView OAuth URL:
```javascript
const clientId = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID';
const redirectUri = 'https://flightbridge.app/webhook/oauth-callback';
const scope = 'flights:read'; // Check FCView docs for exact scope
const state = Math.random().toString(36).substring(7); // Random security token

const authUrl = `https://flightcrewview2.com/logbook/oauth/authorize?client_id=${clientId}&redirect_uri=${redirectUri}&scope=${scope}&state=${state}&response_type=code`;

return [{
  json: {
    redirectUrl: authUrl,
    state: state // Store this to verify later
  }
}];
```
5. Store state in Supabase (for verification)
6. Redirect user to FCView

### 2. **OAuth Callback Workflow** üî¥ **DO THIS SECOND**
**Goal:** Receive tokens from FCView after user approves

**Steps:**
1. Create new n8n workflow: "OAuth Callback"
2. Add webhook node: `/webhook/oauth-callback`
3. Receive authorization code from FCView
4. Exchange code for access token:
```javascript
// POST to FCView token endpoint
const response = await fetch('https://flightcrewview2.com/logbook/oauth/token', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    grant_type: 'authorization_code',
    code: $json.code,
    client_id: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    client_secret: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
    redirect_uri: 'https://flightbridge.app/webhook/oauth-callback'
  })
});

const tokens = await response.json();
// tokens.access_token
// tokens.refresh_token
```
5. Store tokens in Supabase `users` table
6. Create user session
7. Redirect to dashboard

### 3. **Test OAuth Flow** üî¥ **DO THIS THIRD**
- Visit `/webhook/oauth-start`
- Log in with your FCView account
- Verify redirect to callback works
- Verify tokens are stored in Supabase
- Verify redirect to dashboard

### 4. **Fetch Real Flights** üü° **AFTER OAUTH WORKS**
- Build workflow to call FCView API
- Display real flights on dashboard
- Replace test data
